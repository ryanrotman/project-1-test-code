# Project 1 Test Code

## Description
This repository holds some development and test code for my section of Project 1 for [The Coding Boot Camp](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) through the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Professional Education.

As the team is developing our app, I wanted a place to be able to check out my section via a web browser across multiple devices. So I'm utilizing this repository and github pages to do that for me.

My section is developing a search of nearby bars and grocery stores using the Google Maps Embed API. This will eventually be added to the full application developed by my team. This incorporates the use of a modal and inputs to select user input.
